## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my Live Bus Tracker exercise that I'm working on for the MIT xPro coding course. his project gets live bus data from the MBTA API every 15 seconds. The bus locations are plotted on a google map. Each time the position is updated, the route data is updated and shown correctly on the map.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap v5.0

## Setup
To run and see this project, download locally, extract the files, and run the index.html file in your local browser.

## Roadmap
* Get the page styling correct for the map legend
* Add functionality to filter the map by bus route
